## AWS Community Day | Midwest Founder and Organizer
AWS Community Day | Midwest is an annual one-day, technical conference run for the user community, by the AWS user community. The event has grown from grassroots meetups to a full-scale conference, rotating through Chicago, Columbus, Milwaukee, and now Indy. This work reflects my commitment to building inclusive, high-impact spaces where cloud professionals can connect, learn, and grow.
